### Welcome to the website source code!

The source code for the [docs](https://nimblephysics.org/docs/) is in the folder `docs/`.

The raw HTML code for the site exists in the `public/` folder.

To update the public facing site with changes, just run `./deploy.sh` from this folder. You need push access to our [Github Pages repo](https://github.com/nimblephysics/nimblephysics.github.io). The `./deploy.sh` script will automatically rebuild the docs from their source, and push the whole bundle up to the Github Pages repo. Your changes should be live within a few minutes.
